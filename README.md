# Basic In-Game Style Transfer

![](https://github.com/cj-mills/christianjmills/raw/master/images/in-game-style-transfer-experiments/part-1/my_mosaic.gif)

This project uses models trained with this [`fast_neural_style`](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style) implementation to apply in-game style transfer to the [Kinematica_Demo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Kinematica_Demo/) project provided by Unity.

**Important:** This is meant as a simple proof of concept and requires a powerful GPU to get playable frame rates.
